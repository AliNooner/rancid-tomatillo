<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Introduction

Rancid Tomatillos is a playful rendition of the popular movie rating site Rotten Tomatoes. We were assigned this paired project in the first week of Mod 3 at [Turing School](turing.edu) and completed full functionality of the project, as well as an additional feature, within 2 weeks. This project was our first time working in the React framework & Router and helped us to solidify fundamental concepts. We also worked with Cypress testing for the first time in order to test React components & asynchronous JavaScript.

When visiting the application, a user is able to click a movie's poster to view more information about the movie. A user is also able to search for a movie by title using the search bar. This information includes an overview, rating, budget, genres and revenue. When viewing the movie's detailed information page, a user is able to navigate back to the home page.

## Wins
  - Keeping good pacing throughout the project - meeting expectations on deadlines
  - Self-teaching efficiently with new concepts
  - Thorough testing using Cypress
  - Using data down, actions up principles to enact a search feature
  - Close attention to User Experience - reflected in the routing and multiple ways to easily return to the main page

## Challenges & Improvements
  - Deciding whether components should be functional or class components
  - Troubleshooting async issues
  - Possible future improvements:
    - Allow a user to search for movies by genre or rating
    - Build our own backend using Express.js
